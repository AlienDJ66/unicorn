# Business Development

## Core Principle

Business development is not sales. Sales closes deals with end customers. Business development builds relationships that create new paths to revenue — partnerships, channels, alliances, and referrals. The output is not a transaction; it's a relationship that generates transactions over time.

## Partnership Evaluation Framework

### Is This Partnership Worth Pursuing?

```
Score each dimension 1-5:

1. VALUE ALIGNMENT
   Do you share the same customer? (not competitor, complementary)
   Do you share the same values and quality standards?
   Is there mutual respect for each other's expertise?

2. REACH
   Does the partner give you access to an audience you can't reach alone?
   How large and engaged is their audience?
   Is their audience your target customer?

3. EFFORT vs. RETURN
   How much work does this partnership require to maintain?
   What's the expected return (revenue, leads, credibility)?
   Is this a one-time collaboration or an ongoing relationship?

4. TRUST
   Would you refer your best client to them?
   Do they deliver on their commitments?
   Is the relationship balanced (not one-sided)?

Score:
  16-20: Pursue actively
  11-15: Worth exploring, define a pilot
  6-10:  Low priority, revisit later
  1-5:   Pass
```

## Partnership Types

### For Solo-preneurs and Small Teams

```
REFERRAL PARTNERSHIPS
  You refer clients to them, they refer to you.
  No money changes hands — just mutual value.
  Best for: Complementary service providers.
  Example: A web developer and a copywriter.

CO-MARKETING
  Joint content: webinar, blog post, newsletter swap.
  Both parties promote to their audience.
  Best for: Similar audience, non-competing offerings.
  Example: Two coaches with different specialties co-host a workshop.

CHANNEL PARTNERSHIPS
  They sell or bundle your product/service with theirs.
  Revenue share or commission model.
  Best for: Products that enhance an existing offering.
  Example: An AI tool bundled with a consulting package.

COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS
  You contribute expertise to a community (talks, content, mentorship).
  The community becomes a lead source and credibility builder.
  Best for: Early-stage builders establishing authority.
  Example: Teaching in a professional group, then fielding inbound interest.

JOINT VENTURES
  Co-build a product, course, or offering.
  Shared investment and shared revenue.
  Best for: Ambitious projects neither party can do alone.
  Example: A technical builder and a domain expert create a course together.
```

## Outreach Framework

### The Ask, Listen, Do Approach to BizDev

```
1. ASK YOUR WHY
   Why does this partnership matter?
   What do you bring that they can't do alone?
   What do they bring that you can't do alone?

2. LISTEN AND BUILD TRUST
   Start with giving, not asking.
   Share their content. Introduce them to people. Attend their events.
   Listen to what they actually need — not what you want to pitch.

3. DO AND IMPLEMENT WITH MEANINGFUL IMPACT
   Propose a small pilot: one joint webinar, one referral, one co-created piece.
   Deliver results. Let the results speak.
   Expand only after the pilot proves mutual value.
```

### Cold Partnership Outreach Template

```
Subject: [Specific shared interest] — potential collaboration

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work on [specific thing you noticed].
I work with [your audience] on [your expertise].

Our audiences overlap but we don't compete — [explain the complementary fit].

Would you be open to [specific small ask]?
  - A joint LinkedIn Live on [topic]
  - A newsletter swap for one edition
  - A mutual referral for [specific type of client]

Happy to share more context if helpful.

[Your name]
```

## Referral Program Design

```
SIMPLE REFERRAL SYSTEM (for solo-preneurs):

  1. Identify 5-10 people who serve your same audience differently
  2. Have a conversation: "When you see [problem I solve], send them my way.
     When I see [problem you solve], I'll send them yours."
  3. Make it easy: Share a one-line description they can copy-paste
  4. Follow up monthly: "Sent you anyone lately? Anyone for me?"

STRUCTURED REFERRAL PROGRAM (for scaling):

  Tier 1 — Casual referrals: Thank-you note, reciprocal referral
  Tier 2 — Consistent referrals: Revenue share (10-20%), co-branding
  Tier 3 — Strategic partners: Joint offering, shared revenue, formal agreement
```

## Measuring BizDev Success

| Metric | What it measures | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Partnerships initiated | Activity level | 3-5 new conversations/month |
| Partnerships active | Relationship health | Growing quarter over quarter |
| Referrals received | Inbound from partners | Track source for every lead |
| Referrals sent | Your contribution | At least match what you receive |
| Revenue from partnerships | Bottom-line impact | Growing % of total revenue |
| Time to first value | Partnership efficiency | First mutual value within 30 days |

## Anti-Patterns

| BizDev Theater | Real Business Development |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Collecting business cards at events | Following up with one specific person about one specific idea |
| "Let's find synergies" with no plan | "Here's a pilot: one joint webinar, 30 days, we split promotion" |
| Partnerships that only benefit you | Mutual value — if it's one-sided, it dies |
| Chasing big logos for credibility | Building with people who actually refer and collaborate |
| Signing partnership agreements that go nowhere | Starting with action, formalizing after proof of value |

## Power Move

"Evaluate a potential partnership with [company/person]. Score it on value alignment, reach, effort vs. return, and trust. If the score is 11+, draft a cold outreach message proposing a specific small pilot. If below 11, explain why it's not worth pursuing right now."

The agent becomes your head of business development — turning relationships into revenue paths.
