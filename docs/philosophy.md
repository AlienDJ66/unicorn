# Philosophy: Ask, Listen, Do

Whether you're looking for your next AI role, building a side project, or starting a business — before any tool helps you, you need to do the work that no tool can do for you.

## The Three Steps

1. **Ask your Why** — What is your core value? What are your ultimate goals? Ask yourself, ask AI, ask your community.
2. **Listen to your audience, build trust** — Whether 1:1 or 1:many. Listening is how trust is built.
3. **Do and implement with meaningful impact** — Without steps 1-2, implementation is just busyness.

## How You Build

Once you know your Why:

1. **Capture your attention** — Notice what keeps pulling at you. Save it to your knowledge base.
2. **Connect the dots** — Pattern recognition. Form your own thoughts with your opinions and taste.
3. **Create and collect** — Make something. Share it. Listen to what comes back.

## The Three Questions

Before you build anything, answer these:

### 1. What problem are you actually solving?

Strip away assumptions. What is the real pain point? What would happen if this product did not exist? If nothing changes, the problem is not worth solving.

### 2. What is your unique value?

Reframe the problem. What perspective do you bring that nobody else does? Your solution does not need to be better at everything — it needs to be different in a way that matters.

### 3. Who needs this and how will you deliver?

Identify your audience and your delivery mechanism. A great idea with no path to users is just a journal entry.
